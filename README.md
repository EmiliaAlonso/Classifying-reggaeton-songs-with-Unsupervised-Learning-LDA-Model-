# Classifying-reggaeton-songs-with-Unsupervised-Learning-LDA-Model-
The main of this project is to outline the process for using Web Scapping and Natural Language methods to clean and preprocess text data in order to apply Unsupervised Learning (LDA ) for classifying different reggaeton songs based on its lyrics.

In "Extraccion Letras Reggaeton" 740 songs were extracted with Web Scrapping from the page https://www.letras.com/mais-acessadas/reggaeton/, then the dataset was built.

In "Analisis Letras Reggaton" we preprocessed the songs in order to be tokenized, Gensim and NLTK libraries were used. Also the Unsupervised Learning model Latent Dirichlet Allocation was used to classify the songs in topics.
